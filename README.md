# Solving Traveling Salesperson Problem with Simulated Annealing

This uses the Simulated Annealing optimization method (SA) to solve
the Traveling Salesperson problem. It is written in C++ and uses
OpenMP for multi-threading. It doesn't produce the optimal solution
but it can produce a really good solution.

The output is a simple Matlab script that can be copy and pasted
into Matlab to display the solution.
